# audioeditor
This is an updated version of the MATLAB Simple Audio Editor, found here:
https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19873-simple-audio-editor?focused=6783550&tab=function
Updates include:
- works with modern MATLAB versions
- adds MP4 input (will use ffmpeg if the ffmpeg toolbox is installed)

Work in progress. Things that do not work yet:
- saving
- ffmpeg toolbox requires a change. See my comment on the ffmpeg toolbox page.
- probably other things...
